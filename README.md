# Modules-and-Operations-on-txt-file
This Python program first reads the txt file as a dictionary, the keys are the student names, and the values are a list of the students' marks. Operations such as finding the highest average, the highest mark, IQR, standard deviation.. etc are performed on the formed dictionary. This is a practice of modules, statistics, and dictionary operations.
